# SpriterJS

Welcome to spriterJS.

To use spriterJS, first include `spriteJS.js` above all of your js files in the HTML.

`<script type="text/javascript" src="js/spriteJS.js"></script>`

Then, in your JS code, create a new instance of spriteJS

`var spriter = new Spriter();`

SpriteJS handles loading images asynchronously, and allows you to check when loading has finished.

Create an array of images to load into the spriter. width and height is the dimensions of each individual frame in the animation, and mWidth and mHeight is the width and height of the whole object.

```
var images = [
  {
    "name" : "man",
    "image" : "https://cdn.codeandweb.com/blog/2014/11/05/animate-sprites-in-css-with-texturepacker/capguy-walk.png",
    "width" : 184,
    "height" : 320,
    "mWidth" : 1472,
    "mHeight" : 325,
    "timing" : 100,
    "multiline" : false
  },
  {
    "name" : "explosion",
    "image" : "http://apolinariopassos.com.br/dev/spriteOnHover/demo/images/explosion-spritesheet.png",
    "width" : 192,
    "height" : 195,
    "mWidth" : 4800,
    "mHeight" : 195,
    "timing" : 50,
    "multiline" : false
  }
 ]
```

Then give the spriter the array of images to load.

`spriter.loadSprites(testImages);`

The images may not instantly load, as they may be quite large. Before drawing any images, use the `checkLoaded` function to ensure all images are loaded. You probably want this in a loop.

`spriter.checkLoaded()`

Now, during your animation frame, you can call the following to draw your sprite of choice. (pass the name you initially gave in the array of the images to call that exact sprite).

```
var sprite = spriter.getSprite("man");
ctx.drawImage(sprite.image,sprite.x,sprite.y,sprite.width,sprite.height,posData[i][1],posData[i][2],sprite.width,sprite.height);
    
```

///////////////////////////

If your sprite is multiline, you can set `"multiline" : true`. The framework will be able to progress through each frame in your spritesheet.

##NOTE: ALL sprites start off not being animated. Once your sprites have loaded, use the following function to begin animation

`spriter.animate("SPRITENAME", true)`

##Duplication
To duplicate any sprite, call the following function. The first parameter should be the name of the sprite you want to copy, and the second parameter the name of the new sprite you want to give.

`spriter.duplicateSprite("SPRITE_TO_DUPLICATE", "SPRITE2");`


##Multiple animations on one sheet

If you have a sprite that uses differen lines for different animations, you can set the sprite to draw these different lines in animation. To tell spriter how many sprites are on each line, add the following multisheet line to your sprite when loading it into spriter:

```
{
    "name" : "spritegradient",
    "image" : "http://i.imgur.com/y7f1519.png",
    "width" : 40,
    "height" : 40,
    "mWidth" : 400,
    "mHeight" : 400,
    "timing" : 50,
    "multisheet": [
      {"name": "NEW_EXAMPLE_ANIMATION_LINE_ONE", "yPos": 0, "slides": 7, "timing": 100},
      {"name": "NEW_EXAMPLE_ANIMATION_LINE_TWO", "yPos": 40, "slides": 4, "timing": 10},
      {"name": "NEW_EXAMPLE_ANIMATION_LINE_THREE", "yPos": 80, "slides": 6, "timing": 500}
    ]
  }
```

And then change what animation you want to do based on the name you have given it when loading it by doing the following:

`spriter.changeAnimation("spritegradient", "NEW_EXAMPLE_ANIMATION_LINE");`
